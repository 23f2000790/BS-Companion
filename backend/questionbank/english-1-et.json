The artificial intelligence model triggered such alarm with some OpenAI researchers that they wrote to the board of directors before Altman’s dismissal warning that it could threaten humanity, Reuters reported.\n\nThe model, called Q* – and pronounced as “Q Star” – was able to solve basic maths problems it had not seen before, according to the tech news site The Information, which added that the pace of development behind the system had alarmed some safety researchers. The ability to solve maths problems would be viewed as a significant development in AI. The reports followed days of turmoil at San Francisco-based Open AI, whose board sacked Altman, but then reinstated him after nearly all of the company’s 750 staff threatened to resign if he were not brought back. Altman also had the support of OpenAI’s biggest investor, Microsoft.\n\nMany experts are concerned that companies such as OpenAI are moving too fast towards developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), the term for a system that can perform tasks at human or above-human levels of intelligence – and which could, in theory, evade human control. Andrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, said the existence of a maths-solving large language model (LLM) would be a breakthrough. He said: “The intrinsic ability of LLMs to do maths is a major step forward, allowing AIs to offer a whole new swath of analytical capabilities. It’s a big step forward.”\n\nIn an appearance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Altman said: “Four times now in the history of OpenAI, the most recent time was just in the last couple weeks [sic], I’ve gotten to be in the room, when we sort of push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward, and getting to do that is the professional honour of a lifetime.” Open AI was founded as a nonprofit venture with a board that governs a commercial subsidiary, run by Altman. Open AI states that it was established with the goal of developing “safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity” and that the for-profit company would be “legally bound to pursue the nonprofit’s mission.” The emphasis on safety led to the speculation that Altman had been sacked for endangering the company’s core mission.\n\nExcerpted from:\n\nMilmo, Dan. “Open AI Staff ‘Warned Board New System Threatened Humanity.’” The Guardian, 24 Nov 2023.",

These phenomena are often linked to the impacts of global climate change and habitat loss due to industrial agriculture. According to a study published in Nature, climate change and agriculture seem to have a synergistic effect on insect biodiversity, with each magnifying the declines caused by the other.\n\nFor the study, researchers from University College London (UCL) analysed data from more than 750,000 samples of nearly 18,000 insect species that were collected from 6,000 sites around the world over the last 20 years. They compared changes over time in the samples' reported numbers on insect populations and biodiversity to the average and maximum temperatures as well as land use at each site. Each area was categorised as having primary vegetation or low or high-intensity agriculture. The researchers found that rising temperatures are linked to greater population reductions and that there was more loss of species in areas where natural habitats were cleared to make room for agriculture than in undeveloped regions. Areas with temperature increases but undisturbed insect habitats, or disturbed habitats but relatively steady temperatures, experienced smaller losses. In high-intensity agriculture areas affected by rising temperatures one standard deviation above baseline fluctuations, such as some sites in Brazil, the number of insects dropped by up to 49 percent, and the number of species present dropped by 27 percent.\n\n\"In this case, the habitat loss and climate change can often be worse than if they were acting on their own, as one can make the impact of the other worse and vice versa,\" study author and UCL ecologist Charlotte Outhwaite tells the Associated Press. \"We're missing part of the picture if we are only looking at these things individually.\" Part of the problem, Outhwaite explains, is that agricultural development reduces tree cover, making rising temperatures even deadlier for insects that are unable to find shade. Those that survive may then migrate to a new area that's not as well suited to them. \"Our findings highlight the urgency of actions to preserve natural habitats, slow the expansion of high-intensity agriculture, and cut emissions to mitigate climate change,\" Outhwaite tells BBC News.\n\nExcerpted from:\nRobitzski, Dan. \"Climate Change and Agriculture Together Halve Insect Populations.\" The Scientist, 21 Apr. 2022.",

These phenomena are often linked to the impacts of global climate change and habitat loss due to industrial agriculture. According to a study published in Nature, climate change and agriculture seem to have a synergistic effect on insect biodiversity, with each magnifying the declines caused by the other.\n\nFor the study, researchers from University College London (UCL) analysed data from more than 750,000 samples of nearly 18,000 insect species that were collected from 6,000 sites around the world over the last 20 years. They compared changes over time in the samples' reported numbers on insect populations and biodiversity to the average and maximum temperatures as well as land use at each site. Each area was categorised as having primary vegetation or low or high-intensity agriculture. The researchers found that rising temperatures are linked to greater population reductions and that there was more loss of species in areas where natural habitats were cleared to make room for agriculture than in undeveloped regions. Areas with temperature increases but undisturbed insect habitats, or disturbed habitats but relatively steady temperatures, experienced smaller losses. In high-intensity agriculture areas affected by rising temperatures one standard deviation above baseline fluctuations, such as some sites in Brazil, the number of insects dropped by up to 49 percent, and the number of species present dropped by 27 percent.\n\n\"In this case, the habitat loss and climate change can often be worse than if they were acting on their own, as one can make the impact of the other worse and vice versa,\" study author and UCL ecologist Charlotte Outhwaite tells the Associated Press. \"We're missing part of the picture if we are only looking at these things individually.\" Part of the problem, Outhwaite explains, is that agricultural development reduces tree cover, making rising temperatures even deadlier for insects that are unable to find shade. Those that survive may then migrate to a new area that's not as well suited to them. \"Our findings highlight the urgency of actions to preserve natural habitats, slow the expansion of high-intensity agriculture, and cut emissions to mitigate climate change,\" Outhwaite tells BBC News.\n\nExcerpted from:\nRobitzski, Dan. \"Climate Change and Agriculture Together Halve Insect Populations.\" The Scientist, 21 Apr. 2022.",

Judges and magistrates are giving people suspended sentences instead of jail terms on the back of guidance that they should take into account the \"high prison population\".\n\nCriminals who were given suspended sentences because of prison conditions include an inmate who poured boiling water over a prison guard, but had his six-month custodial sentence quashed, and a drug driver without a licence who had led the police on a high-speed chase.\n\nMark Beatties, the national chair of the Magistrates Association, said: \"The high population is now a factor to be considered when the court is deciding between an immediate custodial sentence or a suspended sentence.\"\n\nAndrea Coomber KC, the chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: \"I do think that judges need to be thinking more about where they're sentencing when they sentence somebody, where they're sending them to, and what conditions they're going to be in and whether that actually meets the various goals of sentencing, which do include rehabilitation, at a time when you have such an overcrowded system. It would be fantastic if the incoming lady Chief Justice [Sue Carr] would prioritise that as something in her inbox.\"\n\nCoomber said that the real culprit for prison overcrowding was sentencing inflation, as the judiciary has limited discretion when it comes to sentencing. \"Government needs to take greater responsibility for the fact that sentences are getting longer and that they're the ones doing that,\" she said. \"We've got many more people in that kind of bracket of four to 10 years than we used to have.\"\n\nAdapted from: Siddique, Haroon. \"More Criminals Spared Jail Owing to Crowded Prisons.\" The Guardian, 29 Sep, 2023.",

Not only because I've never written anything before, but also because it seems to me that later on neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the musings of a thirteen-year-old school girl. Oh well, it doesn't matter. I feel like writing, and I have an even greater need to get all kinds of things off my chest.\n\n'Paper has more patience than people.' I thought of this saying on one of those days when I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home with my chin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering whether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I was, brooding: Yes, paper does have more patience, and since I'm not planning to let anyone else read this stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a 'diary', unless I should ever find a real friend, it probably won't make a bit of difference.\n\nNow I'm back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place: I don't have a friend.\n\nLet me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely alone in the world. And I'm not. I have loving parents and a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends. I have a family, loving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I seem to have everything, except my one true friend. All I think about when I'm with friends is having a good time.

In any case, that's just how things are, and unfortunately they're not liable to change. This is why I've started the diary. To enhance the image of this long-awaited friend in my imagination, I don't want to jot down the facts in this diary the way most people would do, but I want the diary to be my friend, and I'm going to call this friend 'Kitty'.\n\nSince no one would understand a word of my stories to Kitty if I were to plunge right in, I'd better provide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike doing so.\n\nMy father, the most adorable father I've ever seen, didn't marry my mother until he was thirty-six and she was twenty-five. My sister, Margot, was born in Frankfurt in Germany in 1926. I was born on 12 June 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I was four.

And I'm not. I have loving parents and a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends. I have a family, loving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I seem to have everything, except my one true friend. All I think about when I'm with friends is having a good time. I can't bring myself to talk about anything but ordinary everyday things. We don't seem to be able to get any closer, and that's the problem. Maybe it's my fault that we don't confide in each other. In any case, that's just how things are, and unfortunately they're not liable to change. This is why I've started the diary. To enhance the image of this long-awaited friend in my imagination, I don't want to jot down the facts in this diary the way most people would do, but I want the diary to be my friend, and I'm going to call this friend 'Kitty'.\n\nSince no one would understand a word of my stories to Kitty if I were to plunge right in, I'd better provide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike doing so.\n\nMy father, the most adorable father I've ever seen, didn't marry my mother until he was thirty-six and she was twenty-five.

He doesn't throw them off.\nOr make an attempt to move away. He lies, staring at the makeshift shop in front of him.\nThe shop: a broken cot with a board nailed to it. Small, fat mangoes heaped in a corner. Bottles of sticky boiled sweets sitting uncertainly on the edge. From a distance, they look filled with colour.\nLike a palm fan, the old cot-shop woman's thin hand, laden with bangles, flaps this way and that, trying to keep the flies away.\nPeanuts heaped in a cone. He stares intently at them. A still mess of tiny worms, glistening in the lamplight.\nHe feels a mad desire. Brush that thin waving hand out of the way. Grab the peanuts and run.\nBut to do this, he must get up. He knows he cannot. His legs have gone to sleep. Heavy, wooden.\nHe looks around him. Dead insects on both sides of his body. What if his body goes stiff forever?\nHe tries to swallow the thick gob of saliva pushing at the walls of his cheeks. It is an effort.\nIn the end, the saliva stays stuck to the roof of his mouth. He tightens his lips into a stitch.\nA massive back cuts his line of vision and hides the cot-shop. He feels relieved, even thankful.\nHe closes his eyes.\nHis stomach, worn thin like a cotton rag, pulls into a spasm. His limbs feel like straw.\nHe must find something to eat. How long can this go on? But then, get up-and do what?\nMaybe he should stretch out and go to sleep.\nA hoarse, loud voice startles the evening, shattering its twilight calm. A song.\nFrom the film showing in the theatre outside which he lies. The hairs on his forearms rise.\nHis body jerks into tremors. It's a while before it dies down, accepting the blare that hits it.\n(From Current Show by Perumal Murugan, translated by V. Geetha)",

What if his body goes stiff forever?\nHe tries to swallow the thick gob of saliva pushing at the walls of his cheeks. It is an effort.\nIn the end, the saliva stays stuck to the roof of his mouth. He tightens his lips into a stitch.\nA massive back cuts his line of vision and hides the cot-shop. He feels relieved, even thankful.\nHe closes his eyes.\nHis stomach, worn thin like a cotton rag, pulls into a spasm. His limbs feel like straw.\nHe must find something to eat. How long can this go on? But then, get up-and do what?\nMaybe he should stretch out and go to sleep.\nA hoarse, loud voice startles the evening, shattering its twilight calm. A song.\nFrom the film showing in the theatre outside which he lies. The hairs on his forearms rise.\nHis body jerks into tremors. It's a while before it dies down, accepting the blare that hits it.\n(From Current Show by Perumal Murugan, translated by V. Geetha)",
