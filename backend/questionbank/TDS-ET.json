        "context": "As part of the course, you have been introduced with the concept of Haversine formula and its use in distance calculations between two points. The below is a transcript of the conversation between a student in TDS and ChatGPT while they were trying to solve the questions in Graded Assignment 6.\n\nStudent-ChatGPT Discussion Thread\nStudent:\nHi, I have two locations with the following coordinates:\n\n- Location A: Latitude = 40.748817, Longitude = -73.985428\n- Location B: Latitude = 40.761293, Longitude = -73.982294\n\nI need to calculate the distance between them. I heard that the Haversine formula can be used for this. Can you help me understand how to do this step-by-step?\n\nChatGPT:\nSure! The Haversine formula calculates the distance between two points on the surface of a sphere (like the Earth) using their latitudes and longitudes. Here's how you can calculate it step-by-step:\n\n1. Convert degrees to radians:\n   Since latitude and longitude are in degrees, you need to convert them to radians. Use the formula:\n   radians = (\u03c0/180) * degrees\n\n2. Calculate differences in latitude and longitude:\n   \u0394\u03c6 = \u03c6\u2082 - \u03c6\u2081 ;   \u0394\u03bb = \u03bb\u2082 - \u03bb\u2081\n   Where \u03c6 and \u03bb are respectively latitudes and longitudes of the locations\n\n3. Apply the Haversine formula:\n\nd = 2r \u00b7 arcsin( sqrt( sin\u00b2(\u0394\u03c6/2) + cos(\u03c6\u2081) \u00b7 cos(\u03c6\u2082) \u00b7 sin\u00b2(\u0394\u03bb/2) ) )\n\nWhere r = Radius of earth (6371 km)\n\nThe term inside the root can be simplified as:\n\na = sin\u00b2(\u0394\u03c6/2) + cos(\u03c6\u2081) \u00b7 cos(\u03c6\u2082) \u00b7 sin\u00b2(\u0394\u03bb/2)\n\nThese are the basic steps. Do you want to start by converting the coordinates to radians?\n\nStudent:\nYes, I converted the latitude and longitude for Location A and Location B to radians. Here\u2019s what I got:\n\n- \u03c6\u2081 (Latitude of Location A) = 0.7112 radians\n- \u03bb\u2081 (Longitude of Location A) = -1.2915 radians\n- \u03c6\u2082 (Latitude of Location B) = 0.7116 radians\n- \u03bb\u2082 (Longitude of Location B) = -1.2914 radians\n\nDoes this look correct?\n\nChatGPT:\nYes, these values seem correct. You have correctly converted the degrees to radians. Remember, you can use the formula:\n   radians = (\u03c0 / 180) * degrees\nYour values for \u03c6\u2081, \u03c6\u2082, \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082 are accurate for the given latitude and longitude of Location A and Location B. You can now use these in the Haversine formula to calculate the value of (a).\n\nStudent:\nOkay, I got the value of a as 0.000000004. Does that look correct?\n\nChatGPT:\nHmm, it looks like your value may be incorrect. Let's check.\n\n1. sin\u00b2(\u0394\u03c6/2):\n   sin\u00b2(0.0004 / 2) = sin\u00b2(0.0002)\n   Since sin(\u03b8) \u2248 \u03b8 for small \u03b8, we can approximate:\n   sin(0.0002) \u2248 0.0002\n   sin\u00b2(0.0002) = (0.0002)\u00b2 = 4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2078\n\n2. cos(\u03c6\u2081) and cos(\u03c6\u2082):\n   cos(0.7112) \u2248 0.7576,   cos(0.7116) \u2248 0.7574\n\n3. sin\u00b2(\u0394\u03bb/2):\n   sin\u00b2(0.001 / 2) = sin\u00b2(0.0005)\n   Again, since sin(\u03b8) \u2248 \u03b8 for small \u03b8, we approximate:\n   sin(0.0005) \u2248 0.0005\n   sin\u00b2(0.0005) = (0.0005)\u00b2 = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077\n\nThis value is much smaller than your calculation.\nSo, I suggest rechecking your second term. Your calculation for the first term is correct, but the second term needs a slight correction.\n\nStudent:\nAh, I see my mistake. I'll correct the second part and continue with the calculation. Thanks!\n\nAssume that the student got the full marks for the answers in Graded Assignment 6.

Calculate differences in latitude and longitude:\n   \u0394\u03c6 = \u03c6\u2082 - \u03c6\u2081 ;   \u0394\u03bb = \u03bb\u2082 - \u03bb\u2081\n   Where \u03c6 and \u03bb are respectively latitudes and longitudes of the locations\n\n3. Apply the Haversine formula:\n\nd = 2r \u00b7 arcsin( sqrt( sin\u00b2(\u0394\u03c6/2) + cos(\u03c6\u2081) \u00b7 cos(\u03c6\u2082) \u00b7 sin\u00b2(\u0394\u03bb/2) ) )\n\nWhere r = Radius of earth (6371 km)\n\nThe term inside the root can be simplified as:\n\na = sin\u00b2(\u0394\u03c6/2) + cos(\u03c6\u2081) \u00b7 cos(\u03c6\u2082) \u00b7 sin\u00b2(\u0394\u03bb/2)\n\nThese are the basic steps. Do you want to start by converting the coordinates to radians?\n\nStudent:\nYes, I converted the latitude and longitude for Location A and Location B to radians. Here\u2019s what I got:\n\n- \u03c6\u2081 (Latitude of Location A) = 0.7112 radians\n- \u03bb\u2081 (Longitude of Location A) = -1.2915 radians\n- \u03c6\u2082 (Latitude of Location B) = 0.7116 radians\n- \u03bb\u2082 (Longitude of Location B) = -1.2914 radians\n\nDoes this look correct?\n\nChatGPT:\nYes, these values seem correct. You have correctly converted the degrees to radians. Remember, you can use the formula:\n   radians = (\u03c0 / 180) * degrees\nYour values for \u03c6\u2081, \u03c6\u2082, \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082 are accurate for the given latitude and longitude of Location A and Location B. You can now use these in the Haversine formula to calculate the value of (a).\n\nStudent:\nOkay, I got the value of a as 0.000000004. Does that look correct?\n\nChatGPT:\nHmm, it looks like your value may be incorrect. Let's check.\n\n1. sin\u00b2(\u0394\u03c6/2):\n   sin\u00b2(0.0004 / 2) = sin\u00b2(0.0002)\n   Since sin(\u03b8) \u2248 \u03b8 for small \u03b8, we can approximate:\n   sin(0.0002) \u2248 0.0002\n   sin\u00b2(0.0002) = (0.0002)\u00b2 = 4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2078\n\n2. cos(\u03c6\u2081) and cos(\u03c6\u2082):\n   cos(0.7112) \u2248 0.7576,   cos(0.7116) \u2248 0.7574\n\n3. sin\u00b2(\u0394\u03bb/2):\n   sin\u00b2(0.001 / 2) = sin\u00b2(0.0005)\n   Again, since sin(\u03b8) \u2248 \u03b8 for small \u03b8, we approximate:\n   sin(0.0005) \u2248 0.0005\n   sin\u00b2(0.0005) = (0.0005)\u00b2 = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077\n\nThis value is much smaller than your calculation.\nSo, I suggest rechecking your second term. Your calculation for the first term is correct, but the second term needs a slight correction.\n\nStudent:\nAh, I see my mistake. I'll correct the second part and continue with the calculation.

Let's check.\n\n1. sin\u00b2(\u0394\u03c6/2):\n   sin\u00b2(0.0004 / 2) = sin\u00b2(0.0002)\n   Since sin(\u03b8) \u2248 \u03b8 for small \u03b8, we can approximate:\n   sin(0.0002) \u2248 0.0002\n   sin\u00b2(0.0002) = (0.0002)\u00b2 = 4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2078\n\n2. cos(\u03c6\u2081) and cos(\u03c6\u2082):\n   cos(0.7112) \u2248 0.7576,   cos(0.7116) \u2248 0.7574\n\n3. sin\u00b2(\u0394\u03bb/2):\n   sin\u00b2(0.001 / 2) = sin\u00b2(0.0005)\n   Again, since sin(\u03b8) \u2248 \u03b8 for small \u03b8, we approximate:\n   sin(0.0005) \u2248 0.0005\n   sin\u00b2(0.0005) = (0.0005)\u00b2 = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077\n\nThis value is much smaller than your calculation.\nSo, I suggest rechecking your second term. Your calculation for the first term is correct, but the second term needs a slight correction.\n\nStudent:\nAh, I see my mistake. I'll correct the second part and continue with the calculation. Thanks!\n\nAssume that the student got the full marks for the answers in Graded Assignment 6. Use the information given in the above conversation to answer the given subsections for the given scenario.\n\nEmergency Medical Supply Delivery in Storm-Critical Zones\n\nBackground:\nThe city of Hillton has been hit by a severe storm, leading to power outages and road closures. The city's emergency response team is tasked with delivering medical supplies to four hospitals located in different areas of the city. Due to time constraints, the response team wants to find the most optimal route to minimize travel distance.\n\nThe team has access to a file called hospital_locations.csv, which contains the following information:\n- Hospital Name\n- Business ID\n- Latitude\n- Longitude\n\nThe 4 hospitals in need of supplies are:\n1. North Hill Hospital (Business ID: 2103) \u2014 (Latitude: 40.7128, Longitude: -74.0060)\n2. Eastview Medical Center (Business ID: 2158) \u2014 (Latitude: 40.7306, Longitude: -73.9866)\n3. Westbrook Hospital (Business ID: 1987) \u2014 (Latitude: 40.6995, Longitude: -74.1745)\n4. Southend Clinic (Business ID: 2895) \u2014 (Latitude: 40.6526, Longitude: -73.9497)\n\nThe emergency response team is currently stationed at the Emergency Supply Center at (Latitude: 40.7222, Longitude: -74.0134). The team must deliver supplies to each of the 4 hospitals and return to the supply center.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the total distance traveled.",
