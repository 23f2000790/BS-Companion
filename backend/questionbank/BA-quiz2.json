The aim of the quality inspection process is to identify defective products. From historical experience, manual visual inspection correctly identified 75% of defective items in any given batch of only defective items. The management has decided to replace manual visual inspection with an automatic detection system (ADS). This ADS runs a logistic model in the background for classifying an item as defective or not-defective based on photos taken by a camera. To test the ADS, a sample of 100 units of X is taken. 30% of the sample contains defective items. The samples are passed through the ADS, and the system identifies 20% of the non-defective items as defective and 10% of the defective items as non-defective. Using this information, answer the given subquestions.",
