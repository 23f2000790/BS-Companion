The company believes displaying all their products together in a single shelf at a retailer store will help boost their sales, as people tend to pick up the items together. Hence, they are currently spending a lot of money to make sure that the retailers display the products together. However, on hearing this, Dr.Milo feels sceptical as it is counter intuitive. He feels that the sales of the products are independent. To check his theory, data in Table-3 was collected. Table-3 contains the total sales (in quantity) of the three products across retail stores. Here, the retail stores were classified in two types: \u201cType-1: The three products are displayed together\u201d, \u201cType-2: The three products are not displayed together\u201d.
